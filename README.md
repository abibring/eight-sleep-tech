# Eight Sleep Technical Assignment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project allows you to view different user's sleep data to gain insight into their sleep.  You can toggle between user's data and view them in various charts.  The items will respond to different screen sizes. I hope you enjoy!
